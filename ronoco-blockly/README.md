# Ronoco - blockly 

Ronoco blockly is a feature under development to replace ronoco nodered with blockly (similar to scratch).

Currently the different blocks of the application are created and ronoco is ready for the editor change. However, it is still necessary to create a parser to transform the description of the blocks by blockly into a json file similar to the one created by Node-RED.
